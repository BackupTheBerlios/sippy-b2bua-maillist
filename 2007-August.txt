Subject: [Sippy-b2bua] Documentacion about installation?
Message-ID: <200708281509.32811.ibc@aliax.net>

Hi, I want to use Sippy B2BUA but don't find a README or any doc about its 
installation, just those two pages:
 http://www.b2bua.org/wiki
 http://www.b2bua.org/wiki/B2BUADocumentation

I need to use a B2BUA between OpenSer and Asterisk because Asterisk doesn't 
allow "Loop Back" from a SIP proxy, so this call back needs to be a different 
call for Asterisk, that's why I need a B2BUA that receives OpenSer's call in 
back and generates new one to Asterisk.

So could somebody tell me how to configure B2BUA? I just see "SipConf.py" as a 
configuration file, but don't know if B2BUA can authenticate itself for 
outgoing calls, and I don't know how to configure it for my needs.

I use Debian Sid with the following python packages:
  python                         2.4.4-6 
  python-minimal                 2.4.4-6
  python-support                 0.6.4
  python2.4                      2.4.4-4
  python2.4-minimal              2.4.4-4

Do I need something else?


Thanks in advance.
